### REACT TO DO APP PRACTICE

- Practicing React JS concepts including props, state and hooks: useState for state management, useEffect for lifecylce or side events, useRef for referencing element on the DOM to get its value, for instance here for input value via todoRef.current.value. 

- JS array functions for CRUD i.e., find, filter, map, and unshift.

- Local storage for persisting the state or the data.
